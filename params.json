For this, all you need is [Processing](http://processing.org).\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if you want to to build everything and operate it with a control box, you will need:\r\n\r\n###Hardware\r\n[Arduino UNO R3](http://www.arduino.cc)  \r\n[Firmata (Arduino)](https://github.com/firmata/arduino): you caught me; this is firmware  \r\nA bluetooth module, like [this one](http://www.amazon.com/JY-MCU-Arduino-Bluetooth-Wireless-Serial/dp/B009DZQ4MG) (optional)\r\n\r\n###Software\r\n[Processing](http://processing.org)  \r\n[Arduino (Firmata)] (https://github.com/firmata/processing): processing library for talking to Arduino  \r\n\r\nTo view a schematic of the controlbox I made `infieri/controlbox/schematic.fzz`, you will need [Fritzing](http://fritzing.org/download/).\r\n\r\nFor help running the sketch see `infieri/README.md`\r\n\r\n## Links\r\nWatch a video of the project in-use [on vimeo](https://vimeo.com/jeffwade/infieri).  \r\nFollow me on twitter: [@jeffthewade](https://twitter.com/jeffthewade)  \r\nAnd instagram: [@jeffthewade](https://instagram.com/jeffthewade)\r\n","google":"UA-53093201-2","note":"Don't delete this file!
