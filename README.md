#IN FIERI
An interactive exhibit built with Arduino & Processing. 

_We continually remake ourselves,_  
_Revising our identities and worldviews._  
_With everything in flux,_  
_Our greatest challenge,_  
_Is to become._  

_In fieri._

##What you need
You can simulate In Fieri on your computer using only a mouse and keyboard to control the sketch. For this, all you need is [Processing](http://processing.org).

On the other hand, if you want to to build everything and operate it with a control box, you will need:

###Hardware
[Arduino UNO R3](http://www.arduino.cc)  
[Firmata (Arduino)](https://github.com/firmata/arduino): you caught me; this is firmware  
A bluetooth module, like [this one](http://www.amazon.com/JY-MCU-Arduino-Bluetooth-Wireless-Serial/dp/B009DZQ4MG) (optional)

###Software
[Processing](http://processing.org)  
[Arduino (Firmata)] (https://github.com/firmata/processing): processing library for talking to Arduino  

To view a schematic of the controlbox I made `infieri/controlbox/schematic.fzz`, you will need [Fritzing](http://fritzing.org/download/).

For help running the sketch see `infieri/README.md`
